    </header>

    <main>
        <p>The plan is to go from this</p>
        <img src="images/existing-garden.jpg">
        <p>To this:</p>
        <img src="images/new-plan.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Where the changes are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>New tiles on both levels (the dark grey in the image)</li>
            <li>New steps</li>
            <ul>
                <li>More central</li>
                <li>Shallower</li>
                <li>Tiled to match</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Better retaining wall</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Rendered (all the white areas in the image)</li>
                <li>Painted white</li>
                <li>A seating area built in to the walls (wood texture in image)</li>
                <li>Some smaller flower beds in the either side of the seating area built in (green leaf texture in
                    image)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Removing the flower beds on the side</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Although happy to keep them if that's easier, just
                    rendering the wall to match new design</li>
            </ul>
            <li>A new smaller modern looking fence between the two levels</li>
            <li>Keep the existing large apple tree if possible</li>
            <li>New shed with tiles under the shed</li>
            <li>New wider gate at the side</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <img src="images/example-walls.png" alt="">
        <img src="images/example-fence.png" alt="">
        <p>These sorts of tiles, wall design, that bench area is nice, but not exactly as I imagined, the little flower
            beds built into the wall look nice.</p>
        <p>Example of the type of diving fence I had in mind:</p>
        <img src="images/example-walls.png" alt="">
        <img src="images/second-example-fence.png" alt="">

        <p>The widened gate I want is due to this issue, the existing gate looks like this:</p>

        <img src="images/current-gate.png" alt="">

        <p>This is too narrow to get a bike through and the fence at the side (orthogonal to the gate) is a non-standard
            length</p>
        <p>We would like the fence to be shortened to be a standard length and the gate to be replaced with a wider gate
        </p>
